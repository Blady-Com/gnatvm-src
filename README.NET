In order to build GNAT for .NET from sources, you need to follow these steps:

- You need a unix-like environment (e.g. cygwin)

- Make sure you have installed the .NET run-time and SDK from Microsoft:
  dotnetfx.exe
  setup.exe

- Add the following directories (or similar) in your PATH:
  $ PATH="/windows/microsoft.net/framework/v2.0.50727:$PATH"

- Then copy/move the src/ada directory from GNAT sources under this directory:
  $ gzip -dc [...]/gnat-xxx-src.tgz | tar xf -
  $ mv gnat*src/src/ada gnat_src
  $ rm -rf gnat-*src

- Then apply the following patch:

  $ (cd gnat_src && patch < ../cil/frontend.difs)

- Make sure you have a native version of GNAT which matches this package in
  your PATH

- Finally build:
  $ make -C cil

  This will create a "ready to use" set of directories "bin" and "lib" under    
  cil which you can put in your PATH:

  PATH=`pwd`/cil/bin:$PATH

- To optionally build the visual studio integration:
  $ make -C cil/vs_integration all install

- To optionally build the run-time for the compact framework:
  $ make -C cil compactlib

  Then use dotnet-gnatmake --RTS=compact to use it
